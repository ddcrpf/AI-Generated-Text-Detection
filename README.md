# LLM-Generated Text Detector

This project is a web-based application that classifies text as either human-generated or LLM (Large Language Model) generated. The application is built using a Flask backend and a deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: The model classifies whether a given text is generated by a human or an LLM.
- **Visualization**: The application provides a bar graph displaying the probability distribution of the classification.
- **Word Cloud**: A word cloud of the input text is generated and displayed on the frontend.

## Model Architecture

The model used for classification is a Sequential neural network with the following layers:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input text sequences into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **LSTM Layers**: Two LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers are used for sequential data processing.
  - LSTM with 128 units (returning sequences).
  - LSTM with 64 units.
- **Dropout Layers**: Added to prevent overfitting with a dropout rate of 50%.
- **Dense Layers**: 
  - Dense layer with 32 units and ReLU activation.
  - Output Dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation.
  
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss, and accuracy as a metric.

## Installation

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Download the model:**

   Place the pre-trained model (`model2.keras`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`) in the root directory of the project.

3. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## File Structure

- **app.py**: The main Flask application file.
- **preprocess.py**: Contains the `preprocess` function for tokenizing and padding input text.
- **plot_prediction.py**: Contains the `plot_prediction` function for generating and saving the prediction plot and word cloud.
- **templates/**: Contains the HTML templates for rendering the web pages.
  - **index.html**: The home page.
  - **predict.html**: The prediction result page.
- **static/**: Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
  - **prediction_plot.png**: The prediction plot generated during runtime.
  - **wordcloud.png**: The word cloud image generated from the input text.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the home page and enter the text you want to classify.
2. Submit the text to get the prediction result.
3. The result page will display:
   - The classification result (Human-generated or LLM-generated).
   - A bar graph showing the prediction probability.
   - A word cloud generated from the input text.
